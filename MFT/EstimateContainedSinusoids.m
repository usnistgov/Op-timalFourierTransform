%   - This code wors only with "regular" time series data "g".
%     Regular means that the sampling rate of the data is constant.
%   - Rather than returning separate sine and cosine parts, this returns 
%     complex "MFT" values
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% - input:
%       g [0..N-1] Time Series Data
%       t [0..N-1] time of the data points
%       nu [1..M]  distinct, real-valued frequency indices.  
%                   Algorithm fails if the nu values are extremely close 
%                   together so consolidate first.
% - output:
%       MFT [1..M] complex sine and cosine parts

% 'Choosing the edgewidth
%----------------------
%- As a nu approaches an edge (0 or N/2):
%   1. The sine average at that nu approaches zero.
%   2. The row of the "aa" matrix for the sine average in that nu approaches all zeroes.
%   3. The col of the "aa" matrix for the sine part for that nu approaches all zeroes.
%- In this case, can get absurdly high values of the sine part at that freq, as it makes little difference to
%  anything in the equations described by aa. The amplitudes of the sinusoids thus found appear to "blow up",
%  becoming absurdly high.
%- The equations are correct, but it seems the suprod values that populate aa are wrong -- simply
%  because they are very small (typically E-10 and E-20) and thus dominated by roundoff error. So the values in
%  the aa matrix become random, so the computed values of the sine part at this nu becomes absurdly wrong.
%- The solution is to declare the zone close to the edge "the edge zone", where the edge zone covers all
%  the nu's where the roundoff error in suprod values is significant. In the edge zone, simply treat the
%  nu as at the edge, and thus omit the equation from the "aa" matrix.
%- Set the edge zone by trial and error, guided by testEstimateContainedSinusoids.tuneNuEdgeWidth.
%  Obvously want the edge width to be as small as possible to get more accurate results, but big enough
%  to avoid the effect of roundoff in computing suprod values.
%- The value of aa that is the smallest, and thus most vulnerable to suprod roundoff, is at the
%  intersection of the row for the sine average of nu and the col for the sine part for nu, the ss suprod
%  value. At the nu near the edge, cc ~ 1, cs = sc ~ 10^-d, ss ~ 10^-2d. The roundoff error of a suprod
%  value using double arithemtic (which is good for 15 decimal places) for time series of 1000 data points or so
%  creates a noise floor around 10^-12 or so. So d is about 6, i.e. set edgewidth so ss(edgewidth) is around
%  10^-12.
%- Set the tol in TestEstContainedSinusoidOnce very low (maybe 10^-7) then watch the failure messages
%  for the degenerate cases as adjust kNuEdgeWidth. To stop the misses blowing up, need kNuEdgeWidth >= 10^-6,
%  or 10^-5 to be surer. Make it too large however, and get other errors ramping up due to artificial movement of
%  frequencies to the edge. Best compromise seems to be about 0.00002.
%- Note that the nu values for EstimateContainedSinusoids must be sufficiently distinct that the rows and
%  cols of aa are not close to being linearly dependent. So consolidate the frequencies first.
